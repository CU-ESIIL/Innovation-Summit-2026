## Research Interests
I am interested in monitoring rangeland health. In my research I work closely with pastoralists communities on what indicators they value for assessing rangeland health and how we can strengthen rangeland remote sensing analyses to reflect such indicators. For example, I am excited to find better ways of using remote sensing to monitor vegetation types and species in rangelands (grassess, invasive species etc), as well as find other ways to assess health and degradation.  

## Fun Fact
Let me think about this one...
