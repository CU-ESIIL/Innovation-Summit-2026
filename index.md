# Welcome to the 2026 ESIIL Innovation Summit
## AI for Sustainability: Translating Environmental Data into Decisions
The 2026 [ESIIL](https://esiil.org/) Innovation Summit will focus on **AI for sustainability**, bringing together teams across academic, federal, industry, and non-profit partners to leverage AI and other analytical approaches to generate new discoveries and insights that will help us better steward our nation’s natural heritage. 

We will focus on [**sustainability**](https://www.un.org/en/academic-impact/sustainability), defined by the United Nations as **meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to benefit from and maintain healthy ecosystems over time**. Further, sustainability balances economic development, social fairness, and environmental protection. 

**A key Summit ❓ will be:** _How can we leverage the environmental data and AI revolutions to make decisions over the next 10 years that set our nation’s species, ecosystems, and     environmental livelihoods on a course towards a thriving future?_

On a daily basis we are generating increasingly more data about our living planet, from species to ecosystems, across scales of observation from gene sequencing to drone-based imagery and satellite detections. We need ‘all hands on deck’ to benefit from ideas that come from across sectors, geographies, worldviews, and disciplines to **generate solutions** that span from management scenarios to environmental technologies. Including a spectrum of ideas and voices will **ensure scientific innovations matter and translate across local to national scales**. 

Summit attendees will learn about AI and data methodologies that are available to tackle environmental challenges and how to apply them in their own research and communities. Teams will converge around AI-ready data sets and AI tools.

**[Key focus areas](https://cu-esiil.github.io/Innovation-Summit-2026/virtual-meetings/) include:**

- Co-producing digital twins for environmental futures
- Building Earth embeddings
- AI and causal inference
- Identifying best practices for using large language models in environmental data science.

**Other potential areas include:** emergent combined AI and statistical approaches that enable interpretation of environmental mechanisms, responsible use of AI in environmental data science, and how AI is a challenge and opportunity to advance environmental data sovereignty. 

**Who should apply?** 
The Summit is designed for anyone eager to shape the future of AI-driven environmental discovery. This event is ideal for researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers who work with, or aspire to work with, AI, data science, and large-scale environmental information to advance sustainability. Participants from a range of different sectors, disciplinary expertise, career stage and experience are encouraged to apply.

Throughout the Summit, participants will co-create insights, frameworks, and solutions that support a more sustainable and resilient future.

**[APPLY HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeS0VqeukcKEbONQvf5lsXpOiOc_4BUbw_MnJZVJIk_Su9o7A/viewform?usp=dialog)** by January 31, 2026

## Goals

- **Inspire** novel AI approaches that unlock the potential of environmental data
- **Grow** AI and data skills capabilities in the next-generation workforce
- **Build** transdisciplinary collaborations and emergent teams across sectors to facilitate data-driven co-development
- Learn, workshop, and create **best practices** in environmental data science and the responsible use of AI

## What to Expect at the Summit
The Summit will take the form of an **‘unconference’**, a flexible and interactive event designed to foster **collaboration and innovation**. Attendees are encouraged to participate in discussions, workgroups, and brainstorming sessions centered around the themes that interest them most. The format encourages **co-creation** of solutions, with ample opportunities for spontaneous interactions and cross-disciplinary teamwork.

What past attendees had to say:

- “The ESIIL Innovation Summit brings together people… to gain hands-on experience developing innovative science questions, big data tools, and working in a collaborative team.”
- "I had a fantastic time at the summit making new connections and learning new environmental data science techniques and research topics that has only increased my passion for EDS and interest in participating in an ESIIL working group. The inclusive environment that ESIIL and the Divergent Science team created played a big part in that. Thank you and I’m so grateful for being a part of this summit!”
- “Get ready to work hard and to grow. You’ll meet a lot of great people from diverse backgrounds.”
- “A highlight of the Summit was the general atmosphere and community. There’s palpable excitement. The unconference format is different from a typical conference, so people don’t always know what to expect—but that’s part of what makes it so engaging.”
- “I see solutions that I did not see before the Summit. I see possibilities for collabs I probably would not have encountered without the Summit."

## Weather and Packing
Boulder is 5,430 feet in elevation and has a sunny, semi-arid climate. Hydrating during your stay is very important, as altitude sickness (headache, nausea, shortness of breath, dizziness, and tiredness) can occur.

Weather conditions can change rapidly throughout each day and from day to day. Layers are always a good choice.

The average temperature in Boulder in May for a typical day ranges from a high of 65-70F to a low of 35-45F. Some would describe the temperature to be moderately chilly. The general area may also feel breezy. The sun is strong in Boulder, so please bring sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat. There are many trails near Boulder, so hiking or running shoes and a set of workout clothes can help get you outside during your stay.

## Transportation

### Air Transportation
If you are flying in for the event you will want to fly into the Denver International Airport (DIA). Note that the airport is quite large and you will need to take an airport train to the main terminal.

### Ground Transportation
**Ride Share**
A Lyft or Uber or airport taxi are the most expensive option but also the most direct way to get from the airport to Boulder (often $70 or higher one way).

**Public transportation to/from airport**
Transit from the Denver airport to Boulder is quite easy via the **AB1 Boulder/Denver** airport bus. This bus runs at least once an hour during the day, with more frequent trips at popular times. To locate the bus, follow signs in the Denver airport baggage claim area to ‘Train to city,’ which will lead you down an escalator. At the base of the escalator, instead of continuing straight towards the visible train station, turn left and you should see a bus terminal with an RTD ticket machine. Tickets for the AB1 can be purchased for $10. Find the gate for the AB1 / Downtown Boulder line.

**Airport Shuttle Services**
If you would prefer to book a shuttle to/from DIA (Denver International Airport) & Boulder:

* SuperShuttle: www.supershuttle.com 800-258-3826

**Car Rentals**
There are a number of rental car agencies located at the Denver International Airport:

* Advantage: www.advantage.com
* Alamo: www.alamo.com
* Avis: www.avis.com
* Budget: www.budget.com
* Dollar: www.dollar.com
* Enterprise: www.enterprise.com
* Hertz: www.hertz.com
* National: www.nationalcar.com
* Payless: www.paylesscarrental.com

**Additional car rental options include:**

* eGo CarShare
* Zipcar

### Transportation around the Boulder area
Boulder has a number of public transportation options for traversing Boulder and the surrounding area


**Bus lines**
[Information about Boulder’s local bus network can be found here](http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/goboulder/bus). Note that the Skip, Bound, and Hop lines pass campus regularly.

If you need to travel to Denver for any reason, the [Flatiron Flyer](https://www.rtd-denver.com/services/flatiron-flyer) bus connects Denver to Boulder. Currently the FF1 is the best option, and connects Denver’s Union Station to the Downtown Boulder Station (with numerous stops in-between).

**Biking & Walking**
Boulder has an extensive system of city walking/biking paths; [maps can be found here](https://bouldercolorado.gov/services/multi-use-paths). [Boulder B-Cycle](https://boulder.bcycle.com/nav/start-riding) is a community non-profit bike sharing system with daily and month passes available.
