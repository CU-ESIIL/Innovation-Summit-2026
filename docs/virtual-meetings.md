# Pre-Summit Virtual Meetings
Summit attendees have the opportunity to learn about AI methodologies that are available to tackle environmental challenges and how to apply them in their own research and communities.Pre-Summit training events prepare attendees for the goals and theme of the Summit.

## Training Opportunities: 
**Choose 1 or attend all 4:**

**Earth Embeddings: Introduction to Earth embeddings and encoding earth data into vector representations** - Date/Time TBD

**Digital Twins: AI and CI tools for continental-scale near-real-time data stream, predictions, and forecasting systems** - Date/Time TBD

**LLMs for robust application in environmental sciences** - Date/Time TBD

**AI for causal inference** - Date/Time TBD

## Dive into our Key Focus Areas

**Earth embeddings**, a type of compression of the original data source, keeps viable information in environmental data while preparing it for use in AI models to make predictions. Break out working groups can use cutting-edge Earth embeddings already developed by the ESIIL team, e.g., the MOSAIKS embedding method tailored to multispectral satellite imagery or CV4E models that leverage computer vision for wildlife images. We seek to inspire teams to develop a critically-needed library of approaches for embeddings that leverage other types of environmental biology data (acoustic data, non-optical satellite data, landscape data, camera-trap data, marine data, and others) that will enable us to use AI to ask questions about how species and ecosystems will respond to future global change.  

**Continental-scale digital twins for the U.S.**: There is a rapid movement to create planetary digital twins, but many lack the domain knowledge and critical data inputs to make them robust and useful. Breakout groups will focus on building a framework and identifying key data, computation, and domain needs for sustainability-focused digital twins. We critically need near-real-time predictions (that could be enabled by edge computing) and longer-term forecasting systems that will derive from digital twins. But we need our environmental data science community to help ground these new AI-driven technologies in scale, appropriate data, domain knowledge, and management objectives. We have the opportunity to create digital twins for sustainable management of our nation’s natural resources and heritage, but need to ground this AI-driven technology. 

**Large language models (LLMS) in environmental data science**: LLMs offer many opportunities for discovery in ecology, evolution, and environmental sciences. AI-generated text can prompt idea generation among science teams and help to leverage entire corpuses of work in specific disciplines. LLMs can also be used to develop datasets that would not have existed otherwise. Moreover, LLMs can be used to assist resource managers and advance conservation applications. Yet, there are critical needs to develop robust and replicable workflows that leverage LLMs, while still adhering to research integrity and ethical use. Break out groups will explore these topics and help to advance LLM-assisted environmental data science and advance best practices across our field. 

**AI for understanding ecological mechanisms & levers for decision-making**:
