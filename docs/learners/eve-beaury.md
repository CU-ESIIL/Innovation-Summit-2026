## About Me
- **Name:** Evelyn Beaury (Eve)
- **Affiliation:** New York Botanical Garden
- **Email:** ebeaury@nybg.org

## Research Interests
I am an invasion ecologist and global change biogeographer. I use spatial data and maps to understand patterns of land-use, invasions, and climate change, and how these factors interact to affect biodiversity. I am looking forward to connecting with other spatial scientists and exploring new collaborations on ecological transformations. 

## Fun Fact
I have a 25 lb. chihuahua mix who is very cute but an absolute menace. I am also a proud CU Boulder grad!
